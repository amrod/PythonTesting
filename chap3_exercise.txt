The library consists of three classes, one representing bank accounts, one representing people,
and one representing monetary transactions. Person objects should be able to draw on zero or more
accounts, and account objects should be accessible to one or more people. Transactions should
represent the transfer of a certain amount of money between one person and another, by transferring
the money from an account accessible by the first person to an account accessible by the second.

Attempts to create invalid transactions should fail.

After having been created, it should be possible to execute a transaction to perform the actual
transfer between accounts.
All monies should be represented as fixed point numbers, not floating point.
